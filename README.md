# Study Platform - High-Level Blueprint  

## 1. Overview  
A web-based study platform where mentors upload **video-based courses**, quizzes, and PDFs. Learners **enroll**, complete quizzes, earn **certificates**, and receive **badges/points**. Course-specific discussions allow learners to interact with mentors. Admins **approve courses** and monitor platform activities. A **Leaderboard** ranks learners based on their earned points.

## 2. Target Audience  
- **Learners**: Individuals seeking structured online courses with gamification.  
- **Mentors**: Subject matter experts creating and managing course content.  
- **Admins**: Oversee platform activities, approve courses, and moderate discussions.  

## 3. Core Features  

### Learners  
✅ Enroll in **free courses** (paid courses in the future)  
✅ Watch **non-skippable** video lectures  
✅ Take **MCQ quizzes** (pass with **70% or higher**)  
✅ Earn **badges & points** for completing courses, quizzes, discussions, and feedback  
✅ **Leaderboard Ranking** (ranked based on points earned)  
✅ Receive **auto-generated** or mentor-uploaded certificates  
✅ Participate in **course-specific discussions**  
✅ **Download PDFs** (only from enrolled courses)  

### Mentors  
✅ Upload **video-based courses, quizzes, PDFs**  
✅ Moderate course-specific discussions  
✅ View learner feedback on courses  

### Admin  
✅ **Approve/reject** mentor course uploads  
✅ **Monitor platform analytics** (total users, enrollments, quiz success rates)  

## 4. High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations  

- **Frontend**: Laravel Blade, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap  
- **Backend**: Laravel (PHP)  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Authentication**: Laravel’s built-in authentication (email/password)  
- **File Storage**: Laravel storage for videos, PDFs  
- **Gamification & Leaderboard**: Custom logic using MySQL  

## 5. Conceptual Data Model  

### Users Table  
- `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role (learner/mentor/admin)`, `points`, `badges`  

### Courses Table  
- `id`, `mentor_id`, `title`, `description`, `video_url`, `status (pending/approved)`  

### Enrollments Table  
- `id`, `user_id`, `course_id`, `progress`, `completed_at`  

### Quizzes Table  
- `id`, `course_id`, `question`, `options`, `correct_answer`  

### Quiz Attempts Table  
- `id`, `user_id`, `course_id`, `score`, `passed (yes/no)`, `attempted_at`  

### Certificates Table  
- `id`, `user_id`, `course_id`, `certificate_url`  

### Discussions Table  
- `id`, `course_id`, `user_id`, `message`, `created_at`  

### Leaderboard Table  
- `id`, `user_id`, `points`, `rank`  

## 6. UI/UX Principles  
🎨 **Modern design** with dark/light mode  
📱 **Responsive UI** (Bootstrap + Tailwind CSS)  
🎬 **Engaging animations** (GSAP, LottieFiles)  
📊 **Progress visualization & Leaderboard rankings**  

## 7. Security Considerations  
🔒 **User authentication** with Laravel’s built-in system  
📜 **Secure video access** (restrict unauthorized downloads)  
📁 **PDF downloads restricted to enrolled users**  
🛡️ **Admin control over courses & discussions**  

## 8. Development Phases  

### Phase 1 - Core Platform Development  
✅ User authentication (learner, mentor, admin)  
✅ Course upload & approval system  
✅ Video-based course structure (non-skippable)  
✅ Quizzes & certificate generation  

### Phase 2 - Gamification & Discussions  
✅ Badges & points system  
✅ Course-specific discussion forums  
✅ **Leaderboard implementation**  

### Phase 3 - Analytics & Expansion  
✅ Admin analytics dashboard  
✅ Future paid courses implementation  

## 9. Potential Challenges & Solutions  

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|---------|
| **Preventing video skipping** | Use JavaScript events to block skipping & track watch time. |
| **Scalability** (Future paid courses) | Use a modular Laravel architecture with Stripe/PayPal integration. |
| **Leaderboard ranking performance** | Optimize database queries for sorting users by points efficiently. |

## 10. Future Expansion Possibilities  
🚀 **Mobile app development** (iOS/Android)  
💰 **Monetization** (Paid courses & subscription model)  
📢 **Live mentor sessions** (Webinars)
